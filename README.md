# DiscGatherer
This is the DiscGatherer software. Its purpose is to help you manage your collection of CD DVD and Bluray dics.

Its only downside, or perhaps an upside as well, is that it is CLI only. No GUI is available.

## Installation
What you need is python3 and pip-ed bson package.
```
sudo apt install python3
sudo python3 -m pip install bson
```

## Usage
Run it with "-h" command to obtain detailed information on how to use it.
```
python3 discgatherer.py -h
```
